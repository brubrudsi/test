In the early decades after 1776, the Declaration inspired more
attention and commentary outside the United States than it did
at home. Little of that attention was directed toward the Decla-
ration’s second paragraph; indeed, most of it either dealt with
refuting the grievances against King George III or reflected
more broadly on the implications of American independence
for the emerging international order of the late eighteenth-
century Atlantic world.
Partisan strife at home, and debate about the nature of inde-
pendence abroad, made it necessary for Americans to rehabili-
tate their Declaration after 1815. A document that had ad-
dressed itself to the “Opinions of Mankind” and to “a candid
World” had to be recovered from its cosmopolitan contexts and
made into something specifically American. This effort of do-
mestication would have two equal and opposite effects: first, it
would hide from Americans the original meaning of the Decla-
ration as an international, and even a global, document; second,
it would ensure that within the United States only proponents
of slavery, supporters of Southern secession, and anti-individu-
alist critics of rights talk would be able to recall that original
meaning.
The very fact of American independence in the eyes of the
world confirmed the effects of this change in the document’s
meaning for Americans. As Woodrow Wilson noted on July 4,
1914, in a speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, “In one
sense, the Declaration of Independence has lost its significance.
It has lost its significance as a declaration of national indepen-
dence. . . . now nobody anywhere would dare doubt that we
are independent and can maintain our independence. As a dec-
laration of independence, therefore, it is a mere historic docu-
ment.”1
The primary intention behind the Declaration of Indepen-
dence in 1776 had been to affirm before world opinion the
rights of one people organized into thirteen states to enter the
international arena on a footing equal to other, similar states.
The authors of the Declaration had sought the admission of the
United States of America to a pre-existing international order;

accordingly, they had couched their appeal to the powers of the
earth in terms that those powers would understand and, Con-
gress hoped, also approve. “In our Transactions with European
States, it is certainly of Importance neither to transgress, nor to
fall short of those Maxims, by which they regulate their Con-
duct towards one another,” explained James Wilson in January
1777.2 In this sense, the Declaration signaled to the world that
the Americans intended their revolution to be decidedly un-
revolutionary. It would affirm the maxims of European state-
craft, not affront them. It would conform as far as possible to
the regulatory norms of contemporary politics. Least of all
would it be an incitement to rebellion or revolution elsewhere
in the world, rather than an inducement to reform.3
The Declaration of Independence has been called “a docu-
ment performed in the discourse of the jus gentium [the law of
nations] rather than jus civile [the civil law].”4 Owing to its suc-
cess in securing American independence, this fact has generally
been overlooked. The document’s opening and closing state-
ments have been taken for granted because in retrospect they
seemed to have enduringly confirmed that independence. Yet
they are, after all, the most prominent sentences in the docu-
ment, the statements of what the United States intended to be-
come: “to assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate
and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s
God entitle them”; and of what they could do once they had
achieved that goal: “to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alli-
ances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things
which INDEPENDENT STATES may of right do.” The rest of
the Declaration provided only a statement of the abstract prin-
ciples upon which the assertion of such standing within the in-
ternational order rested, and an accounting of the grievances
that had compelled the United States to assume their indepen-
dent station among “the Powers of the Earth.”
Though largely forgotten now, this understanding of the
Declaration’s meaning held sway even among American com-
mentators for almost half a century after 1776. Thus John Ad-
ams, writing in 1781, called the Declaration “that memorable
Act, by which [the United States] assumed an equal Station
among the Nations.” For a group of Americans in Paris, writing
to Thomas Jefferson on July 4, 1789, the document was “that
declaratory act which announced to the world the existence of
an empire.” To David Ramsay, in his History of the American Revo-
lution (1789), it was “the act of the united colonies for separat-
ing themselves from the government of Great-Britain, and de-
claring their independence.” For John Quincy Adams, speaking
on Independence Day, 1821, “the Declaration of Independence,
in its primary import, was merely an occasional state-paper. It
was a solemn exposition to the world, of the causes which had
compelled the people of a small portion of the British empire, to
cast off their allegiance and renounce the protection of the
British king: and to dissolve their social connexion with the
British people.” From the other side of the sectional divide,
John C. Calhoun concurred some years later: “The act was, in
fact, but a formal and solemn announcement to the world, that
the colonies had ceased to be dependent communities, and had
become free and independent States.”5
This emphasis on the state-making capacity of the Declara-
tion was partly an American response to a counter-revolutionary
critique of theories of natural rights in the 1770s that foreshad-
owed the much more vehement offensive against the French
Declarations of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in the
1790s. The French Revolution would cast other shadows across
the cause of American independence. The claim of some
French revolutionaries that their movement owed its inspira-
tion to the United States rendered key documents like the Dec-
laration suspect and dangerous in the eyes of those who feared
the wholesale destruction of the political and diplomatic order
of the Atlantic world. Though it is now common to assimilate
the American and French Revolutions to each other, and to in-
clude both in a broader “Age of the Democratic Revolution” or
“Age of Revolutions,” such an identification obscures major dif-
ferences between the two political movements when consid-
ered in their international context.6
International affairs were a major determinant even of the
domestic, American, meaning of the Declaration. The elevation
of the Declaration to the status of “American scripture,” and the
centrality of its second paragraph to that sanctified position,
could take place only once all doubt had been laid to rest
that the American and French Revolutions were but two dis-
tinct moments in a single movement against the established or-
der. In the words of the German counter-revolutionary writer
Friedrich Gentz—translated for an American audience by John
Quincy Adams in 1800—“The American revolution was from
beginning to end, on the part of the Americans, merely a defen-
sive revolution; the French was from beginning to end, in the
highest sense of the word, an offensive revolution.” It was regretta-
ble, Gentz thought, that the Americans had with an “empty
pomp of words” claimed the possession of natural and inalien-
able rights in the Declaration, but fortunately, “they allowed
these speculative ideas no visible influence upon their practical
measures and resolves.” Theirs was a legal revolution, directed
against specific oppressive measures and not against monarchi-
cal principles tout court. On these grounds, “there was, in itself,
nothing unnatural, nothing revolting, nothing plainly irrecon-
cilable with the maxims of the law of nations, and the laws of
self-preservation, in the alliance, which France contracted with
them.”7
The maxims of the law of nations themselves were changing
in the late eighteenth century, and with them, the interpreta-
tion of the Declaration as a document of international law. It
was in this period that “the law of nations, long and inextricably
associated with the law of nature came . . . to be understood
as positive law, made by sovereign states, acting collectively
through authorized means, for their progressively more com-
plex ends.”8 As one contemporary commentator remarked, it
was “hardly possible that the simple law of nature should be
sufficient, even between individuals, and still less between na-
tions, when they come to frequent and carry on commerce
with each other.” States had to temper the law of nature in
practice and by consent: “The whole of the rights and obliga-
tions thus established between two nations, form the posi-
tive law of nations between them. It is called positive, particular,
or arbitrary, in opposition to natural, universal and necessary
law.”9 Thomas Jefferson himself encapsulated the prevailing wis-
dom of the period when he stated in 1793 that “the Law of Na-
tions . . . is composed of three branches. 1. the Moral law of
our nature. 2. the Usages of nations. 3. their special Conven-
tions.”10 These overlapping conceptions of the law of nations
would decisively shape the reception of the Declaration outside
the United States in the decades immediately after 1776.
Reports of American independence traveled immediately
across the Atlantic Ocean and then deep into Continental Eu-
rope in the summer and autumn of 1776. Only two months af-
ter Congress had passed its resolution on July 2, word of inde-
pendence had reached as far east as Warsaw.11 The itinerary of
the news illustrated the remarkable speed of communications
in the late eighteenth century, as well as the richly developed
network of newspapers and journals, and of spies and agents,
that relied on the transmission of such information. Word had
spread first to London, and from there to Scotland, Ireland, and
Holland, before it was carried to the German lands, Scandina-
via, and Southern and Eastern Europe, all in the space of barely
eight weeks.
The text of the Declaration of Independence first appeared
in London newspapers in the second week of August 1776.12
Less than a week later, it was printed in Edinburgh, where the
philosopher and historian (and strong supporter of American
independence) David Hume could have read it on August 20,
only five days before his death on August 25; it also appeared in
the Dublin press on August 24.13 The next week it was re-
ported in Madrid on August 27, and the Dutch press—begin-
ning with the widely distributed Gazette de Leyde from Leiden—
picked it up on August 30; the following day it also appeared in
Vienna.14 By September 2, a Danish newspaper in Copenhagen
carried a translation of the Declaration on its front page. On
September 14 readers learned of it in Florence. The follow-
ing month, a complete German translation was published in a
Swiss journal in Basel.15
Despite this initially rapid transmission through the chan-
nels of late eighteenth-century print culture, the Declaration’s
progress was somewhat hampered by the fact that it was writ-
ten in English. French, not English, was the reigning language
of diplomacy, and English was not yet a major lingua franca
even for the learned across Europe and the Americas.16 The
worldwide community of English speakers would have amounted
to barely more than the 12.5 million “subjects of the British
empire” Arthur Young had estimated in 1772: that is, roughly
the population of Austria (over 15 million), fewer than the in-
habitants of Russia (circa 19 million), more than half the con-
temporary population of France (24 million), perhaps half the
number of the Ottoman sultan’s 28–30 million subjects, but
only a fraction of the nearly 270 million inhabitants of the Qing
empire in 1776.17
Though English would not greatly aid the spread of the Dec-
laration, American independence would in due course help to
secure the global dominance of English. John Adams predicted
in 1780 that “English is destined to be in the next and succeed-
ing centuries more generally the language of the world than
Latin was in the last or French is in the present age.”18 (In this
regard, it is notable that the Declaration seems never to have
been translated into Latin, in 1776 or since.) Two years later,
Caleb Whitefoord, the Scottish secretary to the British peace
commissioners in Paris, concurred when replying to a French
taunt that “the United States would form the greatest empire in
the world”: “Yes, sir, and they will all speak English; every one
of them.”19 Not quite every one within the United States spoke
English, of course. The colonies contained a diverse ethnic mix
of Dutch, Germans, French, and Africans, as well as Britons
and Irish. Indeed, the very first translations of the Declaration,
into German, appeared between July 6 and 9, 1776, as a broad-
side and then in a Philadelphia newspaper, for the benefit of the
local German community.20
In the second half of 1776, the Declaration itself received lit-
tle or no direct commentary in France, Italy, Germany, Poland,
Switzerland, or Spain. The immediate effect of the less specific
news of independence on Europe was minimal.21 Only in Eng-
land and Ireland did it have any direct political consequences.
Supporters of the British cause had predicted that “the Declara-
tion for an Independency must totally silence any Advocates
[the Americans] had in England.”22 Some of the firmer partisans
of the American cause may have been cheered by the news.
Wavering sympathizers of the Americans recoiled as Congress
had clearly marked a point of no return in the conflict with
Britain.23 Edmund Burke, for one, later histrionically confessed
that “the day that he first heard of the American states having
claimed Independency, it made him sick at heart; it struck him
to his soul, because he saw it was a claim essentially injurious to
this country, and a claim which Great Britain could never get
rid of. Never! Never! Never!”24
British and American Loyalist opponents of the American
rebellion either deplored the presumptuousness of the colonists
or took comfort from the fact that a long-meditated conspiracy
for independence had at last been flushed out into the open.
On Staten Island with the British forces, Ambrose Serle, the
secretary to the British admiral Lord Richard Howe, expressed
his horror at the Declaration on July 13, 1776: “A more impu-
dent, false and atrocious Proclamation was never fabricated by
the Hands of Man.”25 Howe himself sent one of the first copies
of the Declaration back to London in August 1776. He also
recognized how it had changed relations between the British
and the colonists when he met a congressional delegation, com-
prising John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Edward Rutledge,
on Staten Island in September 1776: “They themselves had
changed the ground . . . by their Declaration of Independency,
which, if it could not be got over, precluded him from all
Treaty . . . he had not, nor did he expect to have, Powers to
consider the Colonies in the light of Independent States.”26
The most efficient transmitters of the Declaration across the
Atlantic were not the agents of Congress but British civilian
and military officials in North America. During the autumn of
1776, these officers sent five copies of the Declaration back to
Britain, where they later found their way into the British state
papers. These copies now make up the largest collection of
original printings of the document outside the United States.27
At the time, they seem to have aroused no immediate ministe-
rial reaction. What that reaction might have been can be in-
ferred from the response of the exiled former governor of
Massachusetts, Thomas Hutchinson, who was in London just as
details of the Declaration arrived: “The Congress has issued a
most infamous Paper reciting a great number of Pretended ty-
rannical deeds of the King and declaring their Independence.”28
In a delicious irony, Hutchinson had received an honorary de-
gree from Oxford, the most conservative of contemporary
British universities, on July 4, 1776. Within a few weeks of
hearing of the Declaration, he also published one of only two
British pamphlets in reply to it: as well he might have done, for
he was the intended target of some of its most egregious
charges.29 Hutchinson surely shared the sentiments of George
III, who delivered a speech to the British Parliament on Octo-
ber 31, 1776, in which he condemned the “daring and desper-
ate” spirit of the leaders of his American colonies, who had
“presumed to set up their rebellious confederacies for indepen-
dent states.”30
On the western side of the Atlantic, silencing the Declara-
tion was a more effective governmental response to its chal-
lenge than attempting to refute it. When word of the Declara-
tion had reached the British colony of Nova Scotia, in August
1776, the British governor allowed only the last paragraph of
the document to be printed, lest the rest of it “gain over to
them (the Rebels) many converts, and inflame the minds of his
Majesty’s loyal and faithful subjects of the Province of Nova Sco-
tia.”31 Back in Britain, however, the government could not re-
spond openly and officially to the Declaration, for that “would
be to recognise that equality and independence, to which sub-
jects, persisting in revolt, cannot fail to pretend . . . This would
be to recognise the right of other states to interfere in matters,
from which all foreign interposition should for ever be pre-
cluded.”32 Lord North’s ministry did, however, secretly com-
mission a rebuttal to the Declaration, from which these words
are taken. The author of Answer to the Declaration of the American
Congress (1776) was John Lind, a young lawyer and pamphleteer
who had previously come to the administration’s notice with
his pamphlets Remarks on the Principal Acts of the Thirteenth Parlia-
ment (1775) and Three Letters to Dr Price, Containing Remarks on his
Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, the Principles of Govern-
ment, and the Justice and Policy of the War with America (1776).33
Two versions of Answer to the Declaration appeared in 1776.
The ministry seems to have judged that the first version went
too far both in trying to imagine the justifications the Ameri-
cans might have had for issuing their Declaration and in pre-
suming to offer the “Outlines of a Counter-Declaration” that
the king could present in refutation of the Americans’ asser-
tions. The ministry suppressed the initial text of the Answer—
only one copy of which now survives—and had the whole
work revised before eight thousand copies were issued in mul-
tiple editions over the course of 1776.34 Five hundred copies of
this revised Answer to the Declaration were sent from London to
America, to instruct the British forces and to rebut American
arguments in favor of independence.35
The Answer to the Declaration was mostly a point-by-point
examination and refutation of the charges against the king.
Lind denied that the Americans were still anything other than
treacherous individuals, rather than states, and hence argued
that they were still rebels rather than legitimate corporate
belligerents. To do otherwise would have been to make a mock-
ery of the idea of allegiance, let alone legality; after all, if the
colonists were acknowledged to be independent citizens of a
foreign state, what could have prevented a pirate like Captain
Kidd from protecting himself against criminal prosecution by
declaring himself independent? “Instead of the guilty pirate,”
Lind warned, “he would have become the independent prince;
and taken among the ‘maritime’ powers—‘that separate and equal
station, to which’—he too might have discovered—‘the laws of
nature and of nature’s God entitled him.’”
Finally, Lind mocked the colonists for their hypocrisy in an-
nouncing the natural equality of all mankind while failing to
free their slaves: such rights were hardly inalienable, and clearly
not natural, if they were denied to “these wretched beings.”36
Thomas Hutchinson similarly wished “to ask the Delegates of
Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas, how their Constituents
justify the depriving more than an hundred thousand Africans
of their rights to liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and in some
degree, to their lives, if their rights are so absolutely unalien-
able.” The English abolitionist Thomas Day, writing in 1776,
went even further in his criticism: “If there be an object truly
ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolu-
tions of independency with the one hand, and with the other
brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.”37
The Answer to the Declaration was one of only a handful of
contemporary publications to comment on the natural rights
claims of the Declaration’s second paragraph. Among Conti-
nental writers, the French duc de La Rochefoucauld d’Enville
alone, writing in the guise of a banker in London, considered
the claim that all men are created equal to be an established
truth in all religions. He saw nothing in the Declaration’s fur-
ther rights claims that could be construed as a challenge to gen-
eral rights of sovereignty. This was of a piece with his effusive
assessment that the Declaration was “the greatest event of the
campaign, of the war itself, and perhaps of this century.”38
Among British and Loyalist respondents, only Hutchinson dealt
with the question of rights, and even then he did so briefly and
dismissively, while a letter in the August 1776 issue of The Scots
Magazine reduced the Declaration’s self-evident truths to absur-
dity: “these gentry assume to themselves an unalienable right of
talking nonsense.”39 Two years later in 1778, in the course of
versifying the whole Declaration, grievances and all, an obscure
English satirist named Joseph Peart wittily mocked the Ameri-
can assertion
That all men are born free alike,
And are undoubtedly allow’d,
By providence to be endow’d,
(As many a learned author writes)
With some unalienable rights;
’Mong these we lay the greatest stress,
On life, pursuit of happiness,
And (what is best of all the three)
Of uncontrouled liberty.
For surely no one can believe,
But he’s a certain right to live,
Without receiving check or stop here,
As long as ever he thinks proper.40
The “Short Review of the Declaration” accompanying Lind’s
Answer similarly judged the principles upon which the Ameri-
cans claimed their independence to be tautologous, redundant,
inconsistent, and hypocritical. “If to what they now demand
they were entitled by any law of God,” thundered the reviewer,
“they had only to produce that law, and all controversy was at
an end. Instead of this, what do they produce? What they call
self-evident truths. . . . At the same time, to secure these
rights, they are content that Governments should be instituted.
They perceive not, or will not seem to perceive, that nothing
which can be called government ever was, or ever could be, in
any instance, exercised, but at the expence of one or other of
those rights” to life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness.41
This precocious attack on the language of individual natural
rights in the Answer to the Declaration was a significant contri-
bution to late eighteenth-century counter-revolutionary dis-
course. The “Short Review” formed a link between the Ameri-
can and French Revolutions because its main author was not
Lind but his friend the philosopher Jeremy Bentham.42 Bentham
had earlier collaborated on Lind’s Remarks and had prepared a
devastating (but unpublished) criticism of what he called “nega-
tive liberty” for inclusion in Lind’s Three Letters to Dr Price.43
Until the end of his life, Bentham remained critical of the prin-
ciples that underpinned the Declaration. “Who can help la-
menting that so rational a cause should be rested upon reasons,
so much fitter to beget objections, than to remove them?” he
complained in 1789, referring to the Virginia Declaration of
Rights, the Massachusetts Declaration, and the Declaration it-
self; almost half a century later he still called the Virginia Dec-
laration “a hodge-podge of confusion and absurdity, in which
the thing to be proved is all along taken for granted.”44
The basis of Bentham’s criticism remained consistent. As-
cribing laws to nature, and deriving natural rights from such
laws, was not simply nonsense but “rhetorical nonsense, non-
sense upon stilts,” as he called it in his demolition of the French
Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen almost twenty
years after his earlier reply to the Declaration of Indepen-
dence.45 Defensible rights could be derived only from the posi-
tive acts of identifiable legislators. In the relations between na-
tions, the only positive acts were the transactions of sovereigns
that made up a body of positive “international law,” as Bentham
had been the first to call it in 1780. His attack on the premises
of the Declaration may have helped to sharpen his sense that
this new term was needed to denominate an increasingly salient
body of law. If the Continental Congress were to be acknowl-
edged as a legitimate executive body, then its Declaration could
be construed as a positive act within the ambit of international
law. However, it could be acknowledged in this way only if the
Declaration itself were recognized as the positive act that had
endowed Congress with international personality as a sovereign
body. How could independence be declared, except by a body
that was already independent in the sense understood by the
law of nations?
This would be the nub of the legal argument raised by the
Declaration in the decades after 1776. A mere declaration
alone could not constitute independence; it could only an-
nounce what had already been achieved by other means. The
Declaration had thus to perform American independence in the
very act of announcing it. As the French philosopher Jacques
Derrida pointed out in 1976, on the anniversary of American
independence, “The question remains. How is a State made or
founded, how does a State make or found itself? . . . Who signs
all these authorisations to sign?”46 Bentham had asked a similar
question two centuries earlier in his Fragment on Government
(April 1776): “When is it, in short, that a revolt shall be deemed
to have taken place, and when . . . is it that that revolt shall be
deemed to such a degree successful, as to have settled into inde-
pendence?”47 At this point he refused to say, but the question re-
mained when he joined Lind’s attack on the Declaration later
that same year.
American independence could be accomplished only
through external recognition, in the form of tangible mili-
tary assistance and diplomatic and commercial transactions. Ac-
cordingly, Congress instructed its commissioners in Paris, Silas
Deane, Benjamin Franklin, and Arthur Lee, “to obtain as early
as possible a publick acknowledgement of the Independancy of
these States of the Crown and Parliament of Great Britain by
the Court of France.”48 Congress found the long silence from
the French court in 1776 and for more than a year after-
ward particularly troubling. The first American representative
in Paris, Deane, did not receive the copy of the Declaration that
